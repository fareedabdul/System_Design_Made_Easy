What does L4 and L7 mean?

They come from the OSI Model (network layers).

L4 = Layer 4 (Transport Layer) → works with IP + TCP/UDP ports.

L7 = Layer 7 (Application Layer) → works with application data like HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC.


Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancer

Makes decisions based on IP address and port.

Does NOT look inside the content of the request.

Fast and lightweight.


✅ Example:

Client sends request to instagram.com

L4 LB checks → “Oh, port 443 (HTTPS)” → sends it to Server A or B.

 Tools: AWS NLB (Network Load Balancer), HAProxy in TCP mode


🔹 Layer 7 (L7) Load Balancer

Makes decisions based on application-level content (HTTP headers, cookies, URLs).

Smarter than L4.

Can route requests differently depending on the content.
