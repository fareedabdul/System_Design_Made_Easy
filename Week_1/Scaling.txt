Topic 4: Database Scaling

When your system grows, databases can become a bottleneck. Scaling databases ensures your system can handle more users and data.

ðŸ”¹ Two Main Types of Scaling

Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)

Add more resources to a single database server (CPU, RAM, SSD).

Pros: Simple, no application changes needed.

Cons: Limited by hardware; can get very expensive.

Example:

Your SQL server has 8GB RAM â†’ upgrade to 64GB RAM to handle more requests.

Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Add more database servers to share the load.

Pros: Can handle huge traffic; more fault-tolerant.

Cons: More complex (data distribution, consistency).

Techniques:

Sharding: Split database by some key (e.g., user_id) â†’ User 1-1M on DB1, 1M-2M on DB2

Replication: Copy data to multiple servers â†’ improves read performance

Master-Slave: Master handles writes, slaves handle reads

Master-Master: Both can handle reads & writes (complex)
