📒 Day 5 – Caching Basics
1. What is Caching?

Cache = temporary storage that keeps frequently accessed data closer to the user.

Goal → reduce latency & reduce load on the database/server.

2. Why Cache?

Database queries are slow compared to reading from memory.

Example: Searching “Virat Kohli stats” 1M times → better to store result in cache once.

3. Types of Caching

Browser Cache – Stores static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

Application Cache – App layer caching (in-memory).

Database Cache – Store query results to avoid repeated queries.

CDN (Content Delivery Network) – Global cache servers near users.

4. Popular Caching Tools

Redis – in-memory key-value store (super fast).

Memcached – lightweight distributed cache.
