What is Scaling?

Scaling = handling more load/users by upgrading or adding resources.


1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

Add more power (CPU, RAM, Storage) to one machine.

Simple but has limits.

Example: Upgrading from 8GB RAM â†’ 64GB RAM.

Pros: Easy, less complex.
Cons: Expensive, hardware limits, single point of failure.

2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

Add more machines/servers to share the load.

Requires load balancer.

Example: Instead of 1 supercomputer, use 10 normal servers.

Pros: No hard limit, fault tolerance, cost-effective.
Cons: More complex to manage.
