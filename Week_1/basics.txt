What is System Design?

System design is the process of planning and designing the architecture of a software system so it can handle requirements like:

Scalability (growing with users/data)

Reliability (always available)

Maintainability (easy to update)

Efficiency (fast and cost-effective)

Itâ€™s basically how big systems like WhatsApp, YouTube, Zomato, or Uber are built.
